## Research Experience

'Aug 2016 - Current'
__Research Assistant__

San Diego State University

*Project Title:* Fostering Productive and Powerful Discussions among Linguistically Diverse Students in Secondary Mathematics

*Funded By:* CAREER, William Zahner (PI)

+ Designed and updated website for the project (meld.sdsu.edu)
+ Observed units on linear and exponential functions at local high school serving ELL students
+ Performed qualitative analyses to examine teachers’ understanding of mathematical and linguistic complexity within algebra problems
+ Assisted in creation of HLT’s that include both mathematics and linguistic development
+ Will prepare a report for publication
